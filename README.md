Stock Liquidity and Default Risk by Brogaard et al. (2017) - replication

This is my partial replication of this paper. 
I am aiming to replicate Table 4 with amihud liquidity measure (low-frequency liquidity measure). 
I haven't calculated the other three liquidity measures mainly due to data access limitations.

The original paper works with: 
Compustat Industrial files - quarterly data,
CRSP,
CRSP and Compustat merged quarterly database, and
Trade and Quote (TAQ) database (for calculating high-frequency liquidity measures).

My replication uses 
Compustat Industrial files - quarterly data, and
Compustat Daily Updates - Security Daily (substitution for CRSP).

Each Jupyter notebook in this folder is implementing a piece of instruction from the paper. 
Only fully-functional code will be published. 
This replication is still in progress.
